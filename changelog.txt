## 1.0.2

## v0.9.1
- fixed a unittest in vcf_sv_cluster 
- changed the CI pipeline to use release for unittest due to unsolved error https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-htslib/issues/442
## v0.9.0
- updating all dependencies to latest versions, lots of changes in noodles 
- adding possibility to add in vcf merge as well additional fields

- many small changes
## v0.8.8
- breaking change! Sample name in vcf_bnd_2fasta id of FASTA entries is removed as it breaks downstream programs
## v0.8.7
- added in vcf_bnd_2fasta the "simple" option to have simple names of the fasta entries
## v0.8.6
- added in VCF of fragments additional information concerning the position of the fusion on the fragment, similar to the TSV output
## v0.8.5
- subset: read all in RAM then treat instead of on the fly, paves way for non-paired entries and unsorted VCFs 
- subset: natural sorting of output entries by ID
- subset: debug entries from Isoseq pipeline with additional fields.
- subset: more log information 
- tree from BEDPE: more log information
- all: some cleaning and linting

 - correcting coordinates in clustering 
 - cleaning and fixing 0/1 bugs in many functions

 - cluster program allows now to write either stdout or file
## v 0.7.5

- fixed bug where query position was smaller or equal to uncertainty 
- more unit-tests 
## v 0.7.3
- fixed a bug where SA information led to negative value
- new unit-tests for noodles 
- added systematic logger for all functions and unit-tests
- started to add debug logging information
## v 0.7.1
THIS WILL LEAD TO DIFFERENT RESULTS DUE TO SIMILARITY SCORE
- important change cigar evaluation. There was a bug leading to wrong estimates on match length and similarity estimate.
  This regards the usage of the function `eval_cigar` and the generation of the structure `CigarInfos`.
- added unittest for eval_cigar and for `calc_gapcompressed_sim`.
## v 0.6.4

- complete change to unsigned integer for genomic coordinates instead of signed 
- added more unit-tests
- add vcf_chromremoval which selects from a VCF only events matching chromosome list
- fixed but in vcf2fasta for rr events
## v 0.5.8
- fixed in read2vcf wrong direction in some cases - unittest added 
- cleaned with clippy a lot
## v 0.5.7
- in vcf_bnd_subset the check of ID + mateID of pairs now based on "MATEID=" field
- addition of read2vcf to translate BED formated read annotation in a VCF of BND single events 
## v 0.5.6
- added tool to subset a VCF based on BEDPE genomic regions
- changed most (all?) genomic coordinates from i64 to u64
- minor cleaning of the code
## v 0.5.5
- added the program vcf_bnd_2fasta which extracts the FASTA sequence from BND events in VCF files
## v 0.5.4
- added option "--unique-off" which accepts as well multi-mapping reads 
## v 0.5.3
